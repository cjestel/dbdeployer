# 6. Archive Directory
################################################################################

As part of the process of baselining, files will be migrated to the archive
directory.  I suppose over time we may want to purge files from the archive.  
There is no automated method to do this.  Before purging I would make sure that
all instances and developers are up to date before permanently removing files
from here.  

Personally I think items older than 12 months may be good to purge to keep the 
directory size smaller.  We are using a versioning control system, so the files
are nevery actually gone.  Purging is done to make the directory not
overwhelming to look through from a human perspective as well as to not allow
so many files that the file system may begin to have trouble listing the 
directory.
